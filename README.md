# SharePoint Knowledgebase
The SharePoint Knowledgebase is a free, open source, web part that provides a structured knowledge base system for Microsoft SharePoint systems.

## Features of the Web Part
* Ability to add as many questions as you like
* Ability to add and categorize questions into categories (including multiple categories for a single question)
* Search capabilities to find questions and answers
* Rating for each question (was this helpful - yes/no)
* Add comments for each question
* Moderation of questions (or you can leave it open so questions are published immediately)
* View questions by category (with number of questions displayed)
* Quickly jump to any category instantly from the main page
* Assign related questions to other questions
* Attach any number of files to a question

This project was just migrated from it's original home on CodePlex so I'm just getting things cleaned up and setup here.
